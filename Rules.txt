Welcome to Project Duplicity, a Group 3 Project. This is a fantasy-themed card battler where your goal is to battle through the 
various monsters of the lands and reach the top of Mt. Eskervon to restore peace to the world. Though the journey will be long and
difficult, much like any noteworthy adventurer, you can grow stronger through all the strife.

BASICS:

You are a nameless adventurer, for the name is not important; what is important is your mission, which is to reach the top of Mt.
Eskervon. To get there, however, you will have to first cross through the Cirtelgo Plains and Dalihark Pass, staving off dark 
forces along the way. 

You embark on your journey with a set of magic-imbued cards that can be played to damage opponents or ward damage,
depending on the type. Based on what you have to deal with on your journey, you may get new cards with interesting special
effects, and also the opportunity to upgrade your pre-existing ones, to increase their potency. 

Each stage, which consists of the previously mentioned areas, has a series of stages with different encounters. 

Know this: no two journeys will be exactly the same. The world may be cruel or kind to you, or somewhere in between, so your
wits and strategies are crucial to your survival!

ENCOUNTER TYPES:

(The game is in a more basic state right now, so only BOSS encounters are currently applicable to this version.)

You will run into one of four types of encounters along the way to your final goal. These are:
-ENEMY, where you do battle with one of several random foes. The goal here is to defeat this baddie and make it out in one piece.
Through defeating an enemy, you'll gain access to a single card upgrade, which allows you to upgrade a non-upgraded card to its
upgraded state, thus enhancing its power.
-REST AREA, where you can rest to fully heal yourself, or if you're at full HP, upgrade a single card.
-NPC, where you meet with another adventurer or other such inhabitant. They may have you solve a riddle for them, or simply ask
for a bit of generosity. Think carefully about how you approach things, because the NPC might have something quite advantageous
in store for you.
-BOSS, where you duel the final foe of a given stage. Defeating the boss will allow you to move on to the next stage. 

COMBAT SYSTEM AND UI:

Once in a combat encounter, you make the first move. After that, it will the other combatant's turn, and then the turns will 
continue to cycle through in the order until one is victorious.
All foes have fixed movesets that they cycle through, so you have the power of learning and free choice to counteract them. 
When it is your turn, you can play one out of a few cards selected from your deck. You have the choice of:
-Strike, which deals a fixed amount of damage to a foe.
-Defend, which gives you a fixed amount of Block. Block reduces the damage of the incoming damage of the next attack by that
amount, dissipating after. If your block exceeds the damage of the attack, the remainder will heal you. 
-A special attack card, which deals increased damage over your standard Strike, but is limited in quantity and can only be
played a few times during combat. The exact amount of these cards will vary between combat instances, so use them wisely.

Beware: if you fumble your input, or attempt to play a special card when none are left, you lose your turn. 

Regardless of type, after playing a card, the other cards dealt are cycled back into the deck, while the played card is discarded. 
The discard pile will be shuffled back into the main deck when all cards have been played. 

In combat, there are various readouts in addition to your deck and HP. Combat actions of both you and the enemy are displayed, 
along with their effects. Additionally, the fighter with priority will be shown at the start of battle, and the winner of the
fight will be displayed at the end. 

It should be noted that some enemy moves are "flavor", meaning they do nothing by themselves and are marked in quotes. However, 
they should be noted regardless, as they may be the warning that the foe is about to hit you with something strong, or give you
an insight into the foe's mentality.

WIN AND LOSS CONDITIONS:

To win the game, get through all 3 stages and beat the final boss on Mt. Eskervon. 

To lose the game, you run out of HP in a given combat encounter. 

Regardless of the result, you are allowed the choice to restart your adventure from scratch.
