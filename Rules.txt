Welcome to Project Duplicity, a Group 3 Project. This is a fantasy-themed card battler where your goal is to battle through the 
various monsters of the lands and reach the top of Mt. Eskervon to restore peace to the world. Along the way, you will also 
encounter helpful NPCs and rest areas to make sure your kit is well-suited to challenge any meddlesome foe that crosses your path.

BASICS:

You are a nameless adventurer, for the name is not important; what is important is your mission, which is to reach the top of Mt.
Eskervon. To get there, however, you will have to first cross through the Cirtelgo Plains and Dalihark Pass, staving off dark 
forces along the way. 

You embark on your journey with a total of 10 magic-imbued cards that can be played to damage opponents, ward damage, or heal you,
depending on the type. Based on what you have to deal with on your journey, you may get new cards with interesting special
effects, and also the opportunity to upgrade your pre-existing ones, to increase their potency. 

Each stage, which consists of the previously mentioned areas, has a series of stages with different encounters. 

Know this: no two journeys will be exactly the same. The world may be cruel or kind to you, or somewhere in between, so your
wits and strategies are crucial to your survival!

ENCOUNTER TYPES:

You will run into one of four types of encounters along the way to your final goal. These are:
-ENEMY, where you do battle with one of several random foes. The goal here is to defeat this baddie and make it out in one piece.
Through defeating an enemy, you'll gain access to a single card upgrade, which allows you to upgrade a non-upgraded card to its
upgraded state, thus enhancing its power.
-REST AREA, where you can rest to fully heal yourself, or if you're at full HP, upgrade a single card.
-NPC, where you meet with another adventurer or other such inhabitant. They may have you solve a riddle for them, or simply ask
for a bit of generosity. Think carefully about how you approach things, because the NPC might have something quite advantageous
in store for you.
-BOSS, where you duel the final foe of a given stage. Defeating the boss will allow you to move on to the next stage. 

COMBAT SYSTEM AND UI:

TBDL

WIN AND LOSS CONDITIONS:

To win the game, get through all 3 stages and beat the final boss on Mt. Eskervon. 

To lose the game, you run out of HP in a given combat encounter. 

Regardless of the result, you are allowed the choice to restart your adventure from scratch.
